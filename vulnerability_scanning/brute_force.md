# Brute Force and Credential Testing

## Password Cracking

Use tools like Hydra or Burp Suite to test for weak passwords on login pages. Ensure you have permission to perform such tests.

## User Enumeration

Check for user enumeration vulnerabilities by attempting to log in with common usernames and observing the error messages.

# Content Discovery

## Directory and File Enumeration

Use tools like DirBuster or Gobuster to discover hidden directories and files that may not be linked from the main site.

Search for Sensitive Files

Look for common sensitive files like wp-config.php, .htaccess, or backup files that may be exposed.
