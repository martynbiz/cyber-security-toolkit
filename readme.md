# Cyber Security Toolkit

This is a guide to pen testing networks, systems and applications (e.g. websites) which I am composing as an exersice whilst I complete a MSc in Cyber Security. I also intend to use this to test my own Wordpress and other websites.

Ethical Disclaimer: This guide is intended for educational purposes only. Penetration testing should only be conducted with explicit permission from the system owner. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical. Always adhere to legal and ethical standards in your security assessments.
